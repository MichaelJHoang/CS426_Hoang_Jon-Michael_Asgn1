##How does the game follow the required theme?

The reason as to why and how my game followed the theme of the assignment was that it was based on Chicago.
However, instead of focusing on the city itself, I focused on the surrounding suburban/rural areas that surrounds Chicago - which is mostly farms and trees.
What home means to me is being able to experience both urban and rural life without much of a hassle and that as one who comes from the suburbs,
I consider Chicago and Chicagoland as my home.


##How to play this game?

Go to the folder that says that it contains the executable and execute it.

##Controls
WASD - Movement
Left Mouse Click - Shoot

##Objectives
Roam around the map and
tackle or shoot the colored yellow and blue figures for points.
Targeting those that are gray/monochrome does not reward anything and serves as a fake.
